                            <h3 class="h3font18">JAPANESE WRECK</h3>
                            <p>Beach or boat dive Amed - The Japanese wreck is a small fishing vessel that sunk right before the beach. The corals on the boat and around the slopes behind the ship are very diverse and beautiful. A big variety of reef fish is to be found here, as are many nudi-branches. Current can be quite strong sometimes.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3font18">BUNUTAN - House Reef</h3>
                            <p>Beach or boat dive Amed - Our housereef offers something for everybody. Currents can be quite strong, but they bring with them Sharks, schools of barracuda, Giant trevally and other pelagics. When the current is down, it's a good spot to look for different types of eels, octopus, ghostpipfish, ... And if that wasn't enough, the huge fans and very healthy corals continuously keep the place interesting. (due to currents and difficult beach access in the dark, not suited for night dives)</p>
                            <h3 class="h3font18">SERAYA</h3>
                            <p>Beach Dive Tulamben - Bali's famous muck dive. A dream for photographers and lovers of small and weird creatures. A must! The difficulty here is being focussed and maintaining perfect buyoncy :)</p>
                            <h3 class="h3font18">ALAMANDA</h3>
                            <p>Boat dive Tulamben - From the starting point of the drop off, we take a boat and after about 5minutes, we arrive at Alamanda. A beautiful, coral covered slope that holds a lot of secrets. Take your time to explore (or dive with one of our experienced guides) and let the reef come to life.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3font18">GILI SELANG BAY</h3>
                            <p>Boat Dive Amed - The bay leading away from Gili Selang is covered in magnificent, healthy coral fields. Some downcurrent sometimes and cold upwellings. Absolutely stunning dive and definitely one of our favorites. </p>

                                <h3 class="h3font18">BLUU ROCKS</h3>
                                <p>Boat Dive Amed - A divesite that we recently discovered, but only for more experienced divers, as currents and a lot of thermoclines make the diving a bit harder. The colder currents and upwellings create a very healthy reef with a big possibility of seeing bigger things. Very exciting place!</p>
                                <h3 class="h3font18">Chinese RESTAURANT</h3>
                                <p>Boat Dive Amed - Another very exciting place we recently discovered ourselves. We named this site because of the amazing variety of amazing fish we saw during our first dive at this place. Sharks, Rays, Turtles, Octopus, Tuna, Napoleons, ... Strong currents and colder upwellings, make this a divesite for the more experienced diver. This is probably one of the most exciting new divespots around Bali and this will soon be a sought after dive spot!</p>
                                <h3 class="h3font18">GILI SELANG</h3>
                                <p>Boat dive Amed - Gili Selang is the most eastern tip of Bali. On 95% of the dives, at least at some point during the dive, you will encounter very strong current as you pass the rock. However, there are regular sights of Hammerheads, White tips and other pelagics passing by. Only for the very experienced divers. We will only take people if we're really 100% of their skills, as once you're in, there's only 1 way out.</p>
