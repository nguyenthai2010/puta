                                        There are different ways to get to Puri Wirata, depending on your own preferences. The easiest solution is if we send you a driver for a pick up. Prices for a private pick up depend on where you stay on the Island. A Pick up from the airport, in a regular 4 seater car during daytime, would be Rp. 550.000.  Contact us for any transport request.
                                    </p>

                                        A second option to get to Amed, is to take a Perama Tours Bus. They leave from the tourist areas in Bali (Kuta, Ubud, Lovina) and cost about Rp. 150.000/pp. However, they stop in Amed and from Amed, it is another 10 minutes to reach Puri Wirata.  More info can be found on the <a href="http://www.peramatour.com" target="_blank">Perama Tours Website</a> or call them on +62 361 751875

                                        A third option is to rent your own scooter or car and find your way around the Island. An international driving license is needed. And never forget the most important rule in Indonesian traffic: If it is bigger than you, get out of the way.

                                    <p>Puri Wirata is not a 5 star resort. We are a small family owned resort, nothing corporate about us. We are however a PADI 5 Star resort, which references to the services provided by our divecenter (Bali Reef Divers). </p>
                                    <p>However, even we have no star rating, we try to offer the best possible service and try to main a very good price/quality comparison. </p>

                                    <p>At Puri Wirata, you can pay I cash or you can pay by using VISA or MASTER cards. However, we hold the right to charge a 3% fee for credit card payments.</p>

                                    <p>Amed doesnâ€™t really has a center. One would consider Jemeluk bay as the center of Amed, as this is where the boats to the Gili Islands leave/arrive, so that gets quite busy. Puri Wirata is 2km from Jemeluk. However, in our opinion, the better restaurants of Amed are within walking distance from Amed. Snorkeling spots are spread out over the length of the coast, so the best is to get a scooter and get around. </p>

                                        YES! You can! There are now daily fastboats going from Amed to the Gili Islands and vice versa. Trips usually leave in the morning around 9am from Amed. During busy times of the year, there are several trips a day. The companies pick up from the resort. If you want us to book your trip, contact us by mail and we will make sure your spot is reserved. The price is Rp. 300.000/pp for 1 way.
